    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A perfect combo of white and milk chocolate in a creamy, easy dessert that looks amazing! Sure to impress your Valentines.</p>
    <p>Let's do it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4oz (113g) solid eating chocolate</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (160mL) cream (plus more to whip for garnish if you want)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (67g) sugar (plus a little more, potentially)</li>
        <li>a watery liquid (water, milk, coffee, booze, etc — amaretto is especially nice) </li>
        <li>corn syrup</li>
        <li>vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get the chocolate melting in a small pot over gentle heat. Crack the eggs into a heat-safe mixing bowl, fish out the yolks and whisk them into the melted chocolate. Loosen up this chocolate mixture with enough of your watery liquid to make it whisk-able, about 1/4 cup (60mL) but it'll depend on the kind of chocolate you're using. If you're using very dark chocolate and an unsweetened liquid, you might want to stir in an extra teaspoon or two of sugar.</li>
        <li>Whisk and cook the chocolate mixture until you see the egg yolks just starting to coagulate and thicken. If you're not sure, stop whisking for a sec and see of the mixture bubbles gently — if it does, you've gotten it hot enough. Transfer to a bowl to cool and get the pot soaking n the sink — you'll need it again.</li>
        <li>In a different bowl, whip the cream until stiff, then stir in a splash of vanilla. Wash the whisk or the beaters or whatever you used, along with the pot.</li>
        <li> Return to the pot to the stove with about 1/3 cup (60mL) water in it. Stir in the sugar and a glug of corn syrup to inhibit crystallization. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the syrup reaches 240ºF, 116ºC. While you wait, put a pinch of cream of tartar in the eggs and beat to stiff peaks.</li>
        <li>When the syrup is at the target temperature, carefully drizzle it into the egg whites as you continue you beating them. The eggs will cook and start to go glossy. Keep beating for a few minutes until the meringue cools down and is only lukewarm to the touch.</li>
        <li>Beat the cooled chocolate mixture into the meringue until smooth. Beat in the whipped cream for  just a minute, until it's time to scrape down the bowl. Scrape down the bowl with a spatula and use gentle folding to get the mixture homogenous. Pour the mousse into serving glasses and chill before serving.</li>
    </ol>
